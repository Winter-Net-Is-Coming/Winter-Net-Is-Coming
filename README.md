# Al goes exploring

Al Goes Exploring was inspired by educational games of our childhood. They did a great job of teaching while “gamifying” the material. As a child, you’re more engaged with completing the game and the learning seems secondary. We wanted to create that same feeling, while introducing the concepts of algorithms at a much younger age than we did, and hope to instill in them that computer science, and more importantly, learning IS fun.
